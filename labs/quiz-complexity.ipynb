    "$T(n,m)=nm$. There's a couple ways to look at this but the simplest is to look at the work product: the list of first-last name combinations. There are at most $nm$ of these combinations and so we get $T(n,m) = nm$. A brute force approach using a nested loop over the first names and the inner loop over the last names would also give you a complexity of $nm$ because we would get a nested sigma for $T(n,m)$ and solving for closed form would give you just $nm$.    \n",

    "$T(n)=n*n/2$. Given that we want the program to halt eventually, we have to avoid cycles, which we can do by simply marking each node has visited after we execute f() on each node. This implies we can only execute f() once for each node and there are $n$ nodes.  The cost of executing each f() is $n/2$ so the overall cost is $T(n) = n*n/2$.</details>"
